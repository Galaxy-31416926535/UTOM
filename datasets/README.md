# Data download guide

The data used for *in silico* histogical staining come in three sets: **trainA, trainB, testA**. We provide download links for each set.
- trainA (URL: https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/fa25d75a1fcd41cc88d5/?dl=1)
- trainB (URL: https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/6e6d6fbc588b4719a9c0/?dl=1)
- testA (URL https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/bc51e8062b6940db8abf/?dl=1)

Once downloaded, these compressed files (.zip) should be extracted into this directory for model training. A Matlab script describing how we split original big images were also provided here for reference, which can be used for image stitching with minor modifications.

Besides, the complete raw data without screening and preprocessing can be downloaded from:
- Colorectal-AF&HE (URL: https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/6d17f1c642d442afbe65/?dl=1)

If your Chrome misunderstands the security of the download, you can change its security settings or use other browsers.
