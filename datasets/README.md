# Data download guide

The data used for *in silico* histogical staining come in three sets: **trainA, trainB, testA**. We provide download links for each set.
- trainA (URL: https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/fa25d75a1fcd41cc88d5/?dl=1)
- trainB (URL: https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/6e6d6fbc588b4719a9c0/?dl=1)
- testA (URL https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/bc51e8062b6940db8abf/?dl=1)

Once downloaded, these compressed files (.zip) should be extracted into this directory for model training. A Matlab script describing how we split original big images were also provided here for reference, which can be used for image stitching with minor modifications.
